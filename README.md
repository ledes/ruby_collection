### Caesar Cipher exercise

Write code, in your choice of language, that takes as input a string and integer shift and returns that string encoded using a basic Caesar cipher.

[Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

Example: "This is a great method!" , 24 -> "Rfgq gq y epcyr kcrfmb!"

### Unique Values

Imagine we're writing some code for a magazine Editor who would like some help analyzing writing samples. She would like a simple program that takes a paragraph as input, and returns all of the unique words in that paragraph, along with the number of times each of those words occurred.

Example:

p = "To be, or not to be."
      f(p) == [['to', 2], ['be', 2], ['or', 1], ['not', 1]]
